# HW2-socioeconomici-correlation-with-affordable-housing
In this analysis, I am trying to address the issue between whether there is a correlation between socioeconomic index and the number of affordable housing in a certain area
To be specific, I will use a censor data from 2008-2012 regarding economic situation to compare another data from 2012-2015 regarding the unit number of affordable housing program.
